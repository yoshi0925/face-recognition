                    UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO
                    <br>CONSENT TO ACT AS A RESEARCH SUBJECT
                </b>

            <p>
                Dr. John Serences is conducting a research study to learn more about how attention affects how you see things
                (perception) and how you make simple decisions. There will be approximately 5,000 participants in the study
                over the next 10 years.
            </p>

            <p>
                <br><b>PROCEDURES.</b> If you agree to be in this study by clicking “Agree” and continuing to this task, the following
                will happen to you: You will be presented with stimuli that consist of simple shapes presented on a computer
                screen. You will respond with button presses and/or using your computer mouse.
            <p>
                <br> <b>RISKS.</b> You will be required only to continue to interact with your web browser and make responses for a short
                duration. Thus, no potential risks or discomforts are anticipated except for the possibility that some tasks may
                be slightly boring. However, there may be risks that are currently unforeseeable.
            </p>

            <p>
                <br><b>REMUNERATION.</b> In consideration of your time and effort you will receive extra course credit for your
                participation via the SONA system (0.5 credits per 30 minutes, rounded up to the nearest 30-minute increment).
            </p>

            <p>
                <br><b>RIGHTS.</b> If you are injured as a direct result of participation in this research, the University of California will
                provide any medical care you need to treat those injuries. The University will not provide any other form of
                compensation to you if you are injured. You may call the Human Research Protections Program at 858-246-
                4777 for more information about this, to inquire about your rights as a research subject, or to report research-
                related problems.
            </p>

            <p>
                <br><b>BENEFITS.</b> There will be no direct benefit to you from these procedures. However, the investigator may learn more about basic questions pertaining to attention, memory and vision. This knowledge may have benefits to society in
                fields
                ranging from improving education to visual design, but these benefits will be indirect.
            </p>

            <p>
                <br><b>EXPLANATION.</b> Dr. John Serences or a member of his research team has explained this study to you and
                answered your questions. If you have other questions or research-related problems, you may reach him at 858-
                534-3686.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><b>VOLUNTARY NATURE OF PARTICIPATION.</b> Participation in this research is entirely voluntary. There is
                no cost to you for participating. The alternative to participating is not participating. You may refuse to
                participate or you may withdraw at any time without jeopardy to the medical care you will receive at this
                institution, without loss of any access to the care to which you are entitled, or loss of the benefits to which you
                are entitled. You may also be withdrawn from the study if the investigator feels it is in your best interest or for
                other study-related purposes. If you wish to withdraw from the study tell a member of the study staff and the
                testing session will terminate immediately. You will be compensated for the time you have spent.
            </p>

            <p>
                <br><b>CONFIDENTIALITY.</b> Research records will be kept confidential to the extent provided by law. Research
                records will only be accessible by Dr Serences and his research team, and by the UCSD Institutional Review
                Board. You have received a copy of this consent document.
